## 🚀 Data Enthusiast | Aspiring Data Analyst

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently sharpening my skills on **data analysis** and loving every part of the journey! 📊🔍 
I'm eager to learn and improve every day. Whether it's analyzing datasets in Excel, creating dashboards in Power BI, or writing SQL queries, I'm always looking for ways to grow my skills and take on new challenges.  

### 🛠️ Tools I'm Exploring:
- **Microsoft Excel**: Organising, analyzing, and visualising sales data using formulas, pivot tables, and charts.
